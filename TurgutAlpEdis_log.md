On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 17/12/2020 ~
This week I started to work on SwarmControlPanel class and search for SwarmControl algorithms.

### ~ 21/12/2020 ~
This week I tried to design the switch between camera view and map. I completed with one bug and this bug has resolved by Berker. Then, Hakan and I started to work on the formation of drones. We completed the regular formation of drones but not yet resolved the motion of drones. I completed the popup screen to show information, warning, error and completed mission. Hakan and I continue to work on swarm algorithm, adding motion with the help of Berker. With Hakan, we started to work on slider for missions. It is important because for any misclick, it is important to have a criteria to start action and go commandchain. I started to work on pop up screen and helped Hakan to do slider screen. Also, I worked on the last implementations of the project.
