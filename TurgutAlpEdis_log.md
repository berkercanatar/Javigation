On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 17/12/2020 ~
This week I started to work on SwarmControlPanel class and search for SwarmControl algorithms.

### ~ 21/12/2020 ~
This week I tried to design the switch between camera view and map. I completed with one bug and this bug has resolved by Berker. In 23/12/2020, Hakan and I started to work on the formation of drones. We completed the regular formation of drones but not yet resolved the motion of drones. I completed the popup screen to show information, warning, error and completed mission.
