On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week I searched for the splash screen. The ones I found were using JavaFX but I wanted to do it with what we have learned from this course. I designed a splaash screen with our logo with some flight images and group name and manage to create it without JavaFX.

This week I did the Help button and the panel inside it. I waited for other panels to be completed so that I will be able to embed them into the help button. This help button is also a tutorial for the user. Hakan and I tried to create the panel for connected drones. Other group members contributed and we were able to finish the connected drone panel. Berker helped us to put this panel onto map view. Finally, we as a group did the last implementations.
